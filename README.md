Observation One:
While men make up 84.03% of customers, women bought items that on average were 18 cents more on average than items men purchased. Womanâ€™s average total purchase is also 40 cents more than men.  Further research may be necessary into the spending habits of female players. Since women, on average are willing to spend more on an item than male players, marketing research should be done to find ways to both attract more female players and to market items specifically targeting female players.

Observation Two:
The age range of this population is normal distributed with a slight skew toward younger players, most of the players are between age 20-24, which makes up 44.79% of the population. Younger players tend to spend more on average than older players, with the exception being payers ages 35-39 who are willing to spend more than any other age group at an average purchase price of $3.60. Despite spending less on average, more research should be done for marketing to players between age 20-24, as they account for more sales than any other age group. 

Observation 3:
The top 5 spenders spent more on average than the average than the average price of $3.05 for all players. The top 5 players pay an average purchase price of $4.01. More research is needed to find way to encourage top spenders to buy more items. Also, of the items purchases the most popular range between 1.18 and 1.85 more expensive than the average purchase price. More research into why players are willing to spend more on these items is needed.
